# GTNH Space Gas Logistics Terminal

An OpenComputers automation script for GTNH (GregTech New Horizons) that manages planetary space gas extraction using Space Elevator Pumping Modules. Automatically prioritizes fluid collection across multiple planets and displays real-time production analytics.

## Overview

This system uses GT Project Module pumps (T1, T2, T3) with Internet Cards to extract gases and fluids from GTNH space stations. The main script (`autoPump-LargeScreen.lua`) orchestrates pump operations based on configurable demand, while `config.lua` defines fluid sources, extraction rates, and storage targets.

**Features:**
- **Multi-planet fluid extraction** from 7 planets with 40+ unique fluids
- **Intelligent prioritization** using 3 sorting modes (Normal, Stairstep, Waterfall)
- **Real-time analytics**: throughput tracking, delta monitoring, demand percentages
- **Pump tier detection**: Automatically identifies T1 (1x), T2 (16x), and T3 (256x) pumps
- **Configurable storage targets**: Based on ME fluid cell capacities with safety margins
- **Large display support**: Multi-column layout for 4K monitors

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Setup
- **OpenComputers computer** (case, CPU, RAM, hard drive)
- **ME Controller** with interface to network
- **Internet Card** (1 per pump module, for wireless communication)
- **1x Space Pumping Module T1** minimum
- **Graphics Card T3**
- **Adapters mapped to each Space Pumping Module and ME Controller for Fluid Subnet**  

### Optimal Setup
- **Computer with T3 CPU or T3 APU** (faster scheduling)
- **2x Tier 3.5 Memory Cards** (handles 40+ fluid states smoothly)
- **Multiple pump tiers** (T1 + T2 + T3 for max flexibility)
- **Large Monitor** (4K recommended for full dashboard)

## Installation

1. **Copy scripts to OpenComputers hard drive:**
   ```
   /space-pumping/config.lua
   /space-pumping/autoPump-LargeScreen.lua
   ```

2. **Configure your setup** in `config.lua`:
   - Update `currentCellType` to match your ME fluid storage cells
   - Adjust `safetyMargin` (0.20 = 20% buffer before cell full)
   - Rates already calculated based on Wiki (pre-configured values / 20 to convert to L/tick)

3. **Run the script:**
   ```
   autoPump-LargeScreen.lua
   ```

## Configuration Guide

### Core Settings (config.lua)

```lua
config.currentCellType = "16384k"    -- ME cell size you're using
config.safetyMargin = 0.20            -- Stop collecting at 80% full
config.maxTargetOverride = 1000000000 -- Override target (use 0 to disable)
```

**Cell Capacities:**
Pre-configured for AE2 fluid cells. If using different cells, update the `CELL_CAPACITIES` table with your cell sizes in liters.

### Fluid Master List

Each fluid entry requires:
- **priority**: 0-5 (higher = pump sooner when below target)
- **setting**: `{planet, output_slot}` - coordinates on space station
- **rate**: L/s from Wiki ÷ 20 (for liters per tick)

Example:
```lua
['Hydrogen'] = {priority=5, amount=0, setting={8,1}, rate=78400}
```

**Rates Explained:**
- Wiki states rates in L/s (liters per second)
- Divide by 20 to get liters per tick (OC clock)
- T1 pumps: ×4 multiplier
- T2 pumps: ×16 multiplier  
- T3 pumps: ×256 multiplier

## Operating Modes

Press **N**, **S**, or **W** while running to switch modes. **Q** to quit.

### Normal Mode
- Prioritize any fluid below target (100%)
- Within those, pump higher-priority items first
- Then by lowest stored amount
- **Best for:** Balanced filling, especially with priority-4/5 items

### Stairstep Mode
- Pump anything below 10% first
- Then 10-50%, then 50%+
- Respects priority within each tier
- **Best for:** Rapid recovery from empty tanks, dramatic catch-up

### Waterfall Mode
- All pumps focus on the single lowest-stocked item
- Pump it to full capacity
- Then move to next in queue
- **Best for:** Sequential completions, avoiding scatter

**Color Coding:**
- **Red** (<50%): Critical shortage
- **Orange** (50-95%): Ramping up
- **Green** (95-110%): Target achieved
- **Magenta** (>110%): Overflow (space exists)

**Throughput:** Net liters gained in the last 30 seconds across all fluids.

## Troubleshooting

### Pumps Won't Start
- Check ME Controller address in logs (should auto-detect)
- Verify Internet Cards are in pumps and powered
- Ensure planet/slot settings match actual space station layout
- Run `findPumps()` debug function to list detected modules

### Rates Too Slow/Fast
- Verify rates in `config.master` (base rates, before multiplier)
- Check Wiki for latest extraction rates (may change per GTNH version)
- T1: ×4, T2: ×16, T3: ×256 are the hard-coded multipliers

### Storage Filling Unexpectedly
- Lower `safetyMargin` (e.g., 0.10 for 10% buffer)
- Disable low-priority items (set rate=0)
- Use Waterfall mode to focus on fewer fluids at once

### High CPU Usage
- Reduce monitor resolution if possible
- Disable color formatting (edit `drawUI()`)
- Increase `snapshotInterval` (line 17, default 30 = 30 ticks)

## Architecture

- **Hardware Detection:** Auto-scans for GT machines, identifies pump tiers
- **Fluid Tracking:** Snapshots ME network every 30 ticks, calculates deltas
- **Demand Sorting:** Three algorithms (Normal/Stairstep/Waterfall) for assignment
- **Pump Control:** Sets planet/slot parameters, gates work with enable/disable
- **UI Rendering:** Multi-column layout with color-coded demand and live throughput

## Advanced Customization

### Add a New Fluid
1. Look up the fluid on the GTNH Wiki
2. Find extraction rate (L/s)
3. Add to `config.master`:
   ```lua
   ['NewFluid'] = {priority=2, amount=0, setting={planet,slot}, rate=rateValue},
   ```

### Change Pump Behavior
- Edit `tierLogic` table (line 22) to add new pump types
- Adjust multipliers if using modded tiers
- Modify sorting logic in `updateFluids()` for custom prioritization

### Customize Display
- Edit color values in `drawUI()` (hex format like `0xFF6666`)
- Change column layout calculations if using different monitor size
- Adjust fluid list length with `if i > 30 then break end` (line 149)

## Notes

- **First run:** System performs 5-second pre-launch check to ensure all pumps idle
- **Snapshot interval:** Every 30 ticks (1.5 seconds) for delta calculations
- **Thread model:** Each pump tier has fixed thread count (T1=1, T2=4, T3=4)
- **Safety margin:** Prevents overflow; recommend 0.15-0.25 (15-25% buffer)
